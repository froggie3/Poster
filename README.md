# Poster 

This tool allows you to aggregate some of information that you would likely to utilize in your real life, such as weather forecast, RSS feed, and etc.

The application collects the articles from RSS feed you would like to subscribe, or the weather forecast of any locations in Japan which are going to be retrieved from the backend API of NHK NEWS Web. You can expect the tools to post such information on Discord.

The settings are saved by each webhook registrations that you can configure.

Note you can configure the database location via `app/Config/Config.php` or you can add `database-path=<PATH>` option to command-line argument.

```

__The explanation about configuration on Database may be written later__

After you configure everything, you can run this script by:

```

## Terms

Here I am trying to explain the meaning some of the collumn name used the database. To be added more.

### place_id
`place_id` is the rightmost flagment of the URL, which is `13101001310100`.  With this unique ID allocated to each location, we can have this tool get some data.
```
https://www.nhk.or.jp/kishou-saigai/city/weather/13101001310100/
```

### webhook_url

`webhook_url` can be a URL string representing Webhook URL. (guessing we don't need examples right?)
